# What-Makes-the-Best-Wine
This project uses R with read.csv() for loading data and libraries like ggplot2, corrgram, and dplyr for visualization, correlation, and manipulation. PCA and multiple linear regression (MLR) reduce features and compare models, with the quadratic model best predicting wine quality. Box-Cox and other transformations are tested for best fit.
